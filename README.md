# MovieRecommendationEngine
 Recommendation System is a filtration program whose prime goal is to predict the “rating” or “preference” of a user towards a 
 domain-specific item or item. In our case, this domain-specific item is a movie, therefore the main focus of our recommendation system is to filter and 
 predict only those movies which a user would prefer given some data about the user him or herself.
 
### It is based on content based filtering.
This uses cosine similarity to find similar movies based on some common features.
